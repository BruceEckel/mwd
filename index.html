<h2>SCENE ONE</h2>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Excuse me. I received a note saying that I needed to be here at 6:30.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, thank you for coming.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Can you tell me what this is all about?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Well, I'm not supposed to tell you, Mr. Noir likes it to be kept secret, but just between the two of us, he's about to do his big reveal for who murdered Edward Angler yesterday.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>The big reveal! How thrilling!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Would you like a drink?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No thank you. (As she finds what she hopes is the best seat for the reveal) I've heard how Detective Prometheus Noir's big reveals are top-notch entertainment!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADGE opens her purse and pulls a bag of popcorn out of it. She eats popcorn throughout the scene. JOHNNY pours himself a drink. Enter the PROFESSOR and ADELINE. ADELINE has a purse that she keeps with her at all times.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What's all this then?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Mr. Noir would like to speak to everyone.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>We're on vacation! How many times do we need to answer questions to that silly detective.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Prometheus Noir is the greatest detective in the world!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>You are very loyal to your employer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(Enter LIONEL.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>(TO ADELINE) Would you like a drink?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I would.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>You're too young.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>My father died yesterday. That means that I'm a man now.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(LIONEL gets up on stage and tries to grab a drink. JOHNNY doesn't let him. LIONEL gives up and plops down in a chair. ADELINE and the PROFESSOR both get a drink and sit down. Enter MADAM MAPLE from the porch.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>This room is full of darkness.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>You still have your sunglasses on.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Right. I predict that Prometheus Noir will be the next person to enter this room.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(Everyone stops and looks for PROMETHEUS to enter. A waiter enters, grabs a drink and leaves again. They all look at MADAM MAPLE.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>It must be the altitude.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(JOHNNY hands MADAM MAPLE a drink. She sits.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I can not believe it is snowing in June.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Oh goody, are we talking about the weather right before we get accused of murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Ok, what is an appropriate topic of conversation to have before one is accused of murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>I don't know. This is my first time. Hey, little detective.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Are you talking to me?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, what should we talk about?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>You can talk about anything you like.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Maybe it's a test.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>There's no test if you aren't the murderer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Are you implying that I am?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>You're implying that you are.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I am not.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>You know, when I was a kid, I would write myself coded messages. You know, A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. So if I wanted to say cat, I would write out 3.1.20.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What are you talking about?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>The Detective's sidekick wouldn't tell us what to talk about so I'm talking about my favorite subject - me!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>19-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>What are you talking about?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>I'm telling you to shhhhhhh in your code.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>No, you're telling me to hoooooooooo.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>That can't be right.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(There is a crescendo of noise as all the characters try to figure out how to say Shhhhh in numbers. PROMETHEUS NOIR enters by the bar.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Iwlttyafc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I would like to thank you all for coming.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(PROMETHEUS takes very small steps to get up to the stage. He nods at the audience members as he passes them.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>It's not like we were given much of a choice, old boy.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">WahtgattotmoEA. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">We are here to get at the truth of the murder of Edward Angler.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(JOHNNY hands PROMETHEUS a drink.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>His death was an accident.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Jltdoyhwaa. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Just like the death of your husband was an accident.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes. Men get themselves killed accidentally all the time. It's very inconvenient.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">BM. Adnttdoyhwaa. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">But Mr. Angler did not think the death of your husband was an accident.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>He was a contrarian. Besides, Edward slipped in the river while fishing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">N! Iwavcacm. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">No! It was a very cold and calculated murder.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If you are going to make wild speculations, I feel compelled to tell you what your future is.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls out a Tarot Deck.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Iatteam. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I am trying to explain a murder.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, could you please tell us who did it.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Iwgtt. TiaoiwIltrti. Tpts. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I will get to that. There is an order in which I like to reveal the information. To paint the story.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Look at that - The Fool. That's you. Very fitting.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Pdnrmtc. Idnbisn. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Please do not read my tarot cards. I do not believe in such nonsense.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls out the next card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I can see why you tried to stop me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">M-&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Madam -</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The Gonorrhea card.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE shows everyone the card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I did not know they had a card for that.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>What's the point of knowing the future if you don't know if you'll have gonorrhea.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Wadam! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">We are discussing a murder!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>The death of your sex life.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Cypsu! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Can you please shut up!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>So what? Now you're going to tell us it was the Butler in the library?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Iohtsshtfctm,tuitfalaos. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Instead of having the snow storm hinder them from committing the murder, they used it to frame a limited amount of suspects.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You mean us.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">N,syatoowwofits. Iautet. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Naturel, since you are the only ones who went out fishing in the snowstorm. It allows us to eliminate them.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(PROMETHEUS gestures at the audience.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">(. )Bptesuwaiacehbth. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">(CONT.) But perhaps this entire set up was an illusion and certain events happened before they happened.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Excusez-moi but I am confused.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(PROMETHUES takes a sip of his drink.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Nobody can blame you, my dear, he is talking in circles on purpose. He is showing off so that we all get caught up in how clever he is.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>You show some respect!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Idnnfytsufm. N,I,PN,nntphcIabmcim. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I do not need for you to stick up for me. No, I, Prometheus Noir, never need to prove how clever I am because my cleverness is me.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Maybe it's a French thing!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">IanF! IaB! ()&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I am not French! I am Belgian!  (coughs)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I wouldn't go shouting that from the roofs.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You can't blame him, shouting is very European.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I would not call it a French trait.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I'm sorry, of course not, it was just a little joke.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>The French do not need to shout.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">IftairfytmM. ()&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I find that an interesting remark for you to make Madam.  (coughs)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Anybody want to take bets on who the murderer is? 2/1 odds its the creepy kid.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Said the man who keeps hitting on the French gal half his age.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Yavowybcygd. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">You are very open with your betting considering your gambling debts.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I bet you a nickel that I don't have any gambling debts!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">IchtEA,tmtwyoasaom,ind. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">It cannot hurt that Edward Angler, the man to whom you owed a substantial amount of money, is now dead.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>How dare you! Eddie was a good a friend of mine, the reason I owed him money was because I used to owe money to some unsavory people and he paid it off. He would have done it as a gift but I insisted it was a loan. Why would I kill him?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Unsavory people? You mean gangsters? How thrilling!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Ummmmm...yes. Sort of. More just loans with high interest rates, really.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Shame.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I did hear that one of the lenders had a cousin who dated a girl whose older brother was a gangster.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Ooooo la la.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">F! Miaagm. B,LaMMwabffhd. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Focus! Money is always a great motive. Bien, Lionel and Madam Maple would also benefit financially from his death.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Kill my own Father?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Tstbngll. YFidayyash. Nlastlhdiyh. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">There seems to be no great love lost. Your Father is dead and yet you are still here. Not letting a small thing like his death interrupt your holiday.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>Some things in life are more important than death. Like fishing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">N'-p. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">N'est-ce pas.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I can't argue in French, if you could, please, accuse me in English.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">M. Awgteyaaf! ()&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Mr. Angler was going to expose you as a fraud! (coughs)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE pulls another card.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Another gonorrhea card! That's strange, there's only one in the deck.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">SywnwtM. Awgtdyb. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">So you were not worried that Mr. Angler was going to destroy your business.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Mr. Noir, if I killed every mediocre man who threatened my business, I would have to be an exhausted serial killer with no end in sight.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Aywnwayr. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">And you were not worried about your reputation.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>There are those that believe in the gift and those that don't. There will always be skeptics that try to undermine you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Bmotpdnytspoy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">But most of those people do not yield the same power over you.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The fact that you believe that, at my age, I am capable of murdering a grown man, is flattering. Thank you for including me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I wouldn't feel too flattered, he seems to be including everyone.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Show some respect, my boss clearly isn't including everyone as suspects.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(JOHNNY gestures to the audience.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Oh yes, I can't imagine that it was too hard to eliminate those people.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>I would not gain anything financially from his death.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Me neither.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">TivtM,bfgintomfm. N,tmpmigbtaoth. ()&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">This is very true Mademoiselles, but financial gain is not the only motive for murder. No, the most powerful motive is governed by the affairs of the heart. (coughs)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I was his secretary, nothing more.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>And I only just met him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">BcydtmfFwi? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">But can you deny that men find French women irresistible?</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>This is my first time in America -</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Bdhnfoifyp? Itywwtks? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">But did he not find out information from your past? Information that you would want to keep secret?</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>There is nothing in my past that I would murder over.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Me neither.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">ByatM. Anttswy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">But you admit that Mr. Angler never tried to sleep with you.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I do.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ethswesby. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Even though he slept with every secretary before you.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>That's the rumor.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">T'tt! ()&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">That's the truth!  (coughs)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I didn't apply to be his secretary hoping that he would sleep with me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ydnfsbh? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">You did not feel slighted by him?</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No, I found it very refreshing to file papers without any sexual harassment.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Awatroy? ()Wybstb? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">And what about the rest of you? (Coughs) Would you be susceptible to blackmail?</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>LIONEL</span></h3>
<h3>My father was a lot of things but he was not a blackmailer!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Tit! ()Bam,bmbootmvcahcc()fiptcoj(). Ivgott! Icnsb-&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">That is true! (Coughs) But after murder, blackmail may be one of the most vile crimes a human can commit (coughs) for it perverts the course of justice (coughs). It values greed over the truth! I can not stand by -</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(PROMETHEUS drops down to one knee.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Sir! Are you ok?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(JOHNNY runs up to help him but he waves him away.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Iwn-&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I will not -</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(PROMETHEUS begins to spit up blood. All the other characters get up to huddle around him. PROMETHEUS has one more gasp and dies. MADGE checks his pulse.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>He's dead.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If only men could get to the point.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE takes a sip of her drink.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>He must have been poisoned.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE spits her drink into JOHNNY's face. JOHNNY pauses and opens his mouth to let the liquid in his mouth fall into his glass. The PROFESSOR licks his hand to get any liquid residue off. ADELINE faints back on the couch. MADGE stops eating her popcorn and drops her hand back down, realizes that her popcorn was from her purse and starts eating it again.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>It must have been in something he drank. Or ate.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADGE spits out her popcorn.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What did he have for dinner?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>*names something every diner (or most of them) is having right then*</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(The cast all say they would never eat that, etc., Then slowly turn and stare at the audience.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT) No, he can't be dead.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(JOHNNY tries to resuscitate PROMETHEUS NOIR. He does not know how to resuscitate someone and struggles with his attempt. It ends with PROMETHEUS NOIR spitting blood in JOHNNY's face.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>(CONT) Ok, he's dead.</h3>
<h2>SCENE TWENTY-THREE</h2>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">BIand! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Because I am not dead!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(Everyone gasps.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Yes, that's what I was going to say.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What's the point of this?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>No wonder the seance didn't work.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>You said you talked to him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>You shut your mouth.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>(Coming around) Owwwwww.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>So nobody killed Mr. Noir.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">N,Ifmod. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">No, I faked my own death.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>That would explain your body disappearing.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>My head.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I remember when French people were French and dead people were dead.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">NIwetywtmi. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Now I will explain to you who the murderer is.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Shut up!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Em? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Excusez moi?</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>You figured out who the murderer was and instead of telling us you faked your own death and took a nap for the last hour. We are going to figure out who the murderer is.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Why didn't you tell us who the murderer was before you faked your own death?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ittwbo! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I thought that would be obvious!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>If you had revealed who the murderer was, the tragedy of Lionel's death could have been avoided.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">O,bagtwho. Mod. TortmdnkmibhtIwad. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Oui, but a greater tragedy would have occurred. My own death. The only reason the murderer did not kill me is because he thought I was already dead.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I think everything is beginning to fall into place.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>If you know who the murderer is you have to tell us right now before you're killed too.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>He's right, if you know, you are in danger.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I want to know what the commoners think.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>That's not a bad idea. All of you have a sheet with all of our names on it. Check the box of the name of the person that you think is the murderer and stick it into the envelope. Once you have done that, lift your hand in the air and we will collect it. We will give you a couple of minutes to turn those in and will let you know if you are right or not.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>What's the point of that?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Power in numbers.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Is it always this confusing in America when you want to arrest someone for murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">N,upamtrtmbm. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">No, usually people allow me to reveal the murderer by myself.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>You lost that right when you got Lionel killed.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">YdnelL! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">You did not even like Lionel!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I don't like anyone! We should be quiet while the riff raff discuss the answer. How about, so nobody else gets killed, we all go sit in different corners quietly. All of you, feel free to walk around the room, we have the scrap of paper here if you want to see it, and discuss the answer amongst yourselves. You can raise your hand up when you think you know the answer and we will get your envelope.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE sits at the bar, PROMETHEUS and MADGE at the library, the PROFESSOR and JOHNNY by the fireplace, ADELINE in her chair. The BARTENDER collects the guesses from the tables.)</span></h3>
<h2>SCENE TWENTY-FOUR</h2>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>That's all the guesses in.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>So who wants to tell us what happened?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">IrtwIaht-&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I realized that when I arrived here that -</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Not you!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Madge, where should we begin?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>The library! We all thought Lionel was dumb because he was such an idiot, but look - he actually did something clever.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Not clever enough to still be alive.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>He told us how much he enjoyed using numbers as words and look. He rearranged the books so that the numbers would spell something out.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>What does it say?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Quick, write this down 9-20. New word. 23-1-19. New word 10-16. What does that say, if 1 is A and 2 is B and so on, just like he told us.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>It says (the Professor's voice trails off)</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>It says - "It was JP." Your initials are JP.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>This must be some sick joke.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(TO JOHNNY) Your initials are JP too.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>That's true but so are Madam Maple's. Madam Maple is her stage name, her real name is Josephine Pickering.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But it does eliminate Adeline and me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Can I finally get untied?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Does this mean you aren't Canadian?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Why would it mean that?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>A man can dream.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>It's possible that someone cracked the code and swapped out the books to change the initials out to divert suspicion.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>(To the table next to the library) Did any of you see someone messing with the library?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And the scrap piece of paper, we were all forgetting one important fact. That Mr. Noir was French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>EVERYONE ELSE</span></h3>
<h3>Belgian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Thank you. So the note was in French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>EVERYONE ELSE</span></h3>
<h3>Belgian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No, he spoke French.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Such a shame.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And chat in French doesn't mean chat.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>It means cat.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>The cat did it?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>No.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I assume that somehow the cat thing refers to Madam Maple.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Being accused of murder at my age is quite thrilling, but then again, anything at my age is quite thrilling.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>So you thought putting the word chat - not meaning chat - but meaning cat would be enough of a hint for us to solve the murder?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Bs. Hmmcypn? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Bien sur. How much more could you possibly need?</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>So whoever killed Edward Angler would go on to kill Lionel Angler, and injure that Canadian.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">WIbatmlwid,Idtfmodiotetk. WIwttasomc,Intdsoawcomot-C. SiodC,Ispabcimm,aaboaapmlcfy. Ilacimhsycafotcwm. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">When I became aware that my life was in danger, I decided to fake my own death in order to evade the killer. When I went to take a sip of my coffee, I noticed the distinct scent of almonds which could only mean one thing - Cyanide. So instead of drinking Cyanide, I simply put a blood capsule in my mouth, ate a bunch of almonds and performed my little charade for you. I left a clue in my hand so you could all figure out the crime without me.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(There is a pause. Nobody is as impressed by PROMETHEUS' reveal as he thought they would be.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Swell.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>So the killer only killed the father and son Angler men.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">O,hiwh. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Oui, here is what happened.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Oh shut up! What have you been doing this whole time? Napping in your room?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ihb-&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I have been -</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>I don't care! It's Madge who has been working it out. Let her reveal everything.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>We did ask for the input of the other guests. Should we see what they have to say?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(The tables should be grouped together by answer (e.g. Tables 1, 4, and 5 thought it was Madge, etc.). And the character of MADGE goes through each answer and explains why it is incorrect. If a character is not guessed it can either be skipped or still be given a quick addressing.)</span></h3>
<h2>SCENE TWENTY-SIX</h2>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>I knew you'd be clever enough to figure it out. I'm surprised that those simpletons did. But you... I knew I was in trouble when I met you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Is that why you wouldn't kiss me? Because you thought I would care that you're a murderer?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Well....yes. But that's not why I didn't kiss you. Madge, you're adopted. Didn't you ever wonder who your family was?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I actually think I did figure out who my family is or was. I think Edward Angler was my Father.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>I think Lionel figured it out too. When you said that that his Father never tried anything on with you, well you see, that really was very unusual behavior. I think he slept with every secretary that he ever had.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>That's why I had a soft spot for him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>And for me.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>What do you mean?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>I'm also an orphan. I had a fraternal twin sister. We were separated at birth. You're my sister. That's why I couldn't kiss you. I wish I could, you're the most amazing woman I have ever met and I'm so proud of you! All the money will go to you now! You should become a detective. Make some good come out of all of this.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>So you're admitting to the murders?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>You know it was me. Tell everyone how you figured it out. You deserve to show off.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>It all started with the murder of Edward Angler. It was actually a bit of luck, perhaps (to Madam Maple) destiny, that helped you murder him in Almont, of all places. Your friend at the travel agency told you that he would be taking his vacation here and so you set your plan in motion. When it started snowing, you were clever enough to wade through the river to murder Edward, stage it to look like an accident, and return to Mr. Noir. I think you've been using your position to get some financial advantages. Mr. Noir underpays you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ibyp! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I beg your pardon!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>So you realized, that during the course of a murder investigation, you learn all sorts of dirty secrets from the people who aren't murderers, but are scrutinized by Mr. Noir. So you started blackmailing everyone you could.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>It wasn't bad income.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">A! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Absolument!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>That is why Prometheus aired everyone's dirty laundry at the murder reveal. He didn't want to give you the chance to blackmail anymore.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">E! Mgsrty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Exactement! My genius saw right through you.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>So you tried to kill the man that you knew would figure out that you were the murderer.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Ihafio. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">I had already figured it out.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But he could smell the cyanide.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">O,Isi! IinsetkPN! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Oui, I smelled it! It is not so easy to kill Prometheus Noir!</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Can you please shut up so I don't have to kill you a second time.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I think you hated Mr. Angler.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>You mean Daddy Dearest.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And Lionel figured out that you were the killer when you said you had webbed feet. Because Lionel also had webbed feet which is a trait that you inherited from your Father. That is why he dropped the book when you said you had webbed feet, and why he had such a strong negative reaction to me suggesting he design sandals.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>I mean, that's a stretch. Everyone hates feet.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Nobody should show their feet in public.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>And with Lionel dead, you could inherit the massive Angler fortune.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>So that we could inherit all the money. You might not believe this, sister, but my plan was to find you after all this was done. Imagine my surprise when I figured out that you were here too!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>But Lionel knew that he had siblings. He must have overheard one too many of his parent's fights. And when you said that you "had webbed feet," he knew that you were his brother because he had webbed feet too. So he left his secret code in the library, but didn't tell any of us. He was young and found it hard to believe that anyone would actually murder him.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>That's right! Oh the arrogance of youth.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>We knew the killer had to be left-handed because of the angle in which the knife went into Lionel. We knew the initials because of Lionel's clue. You also played hide and go seek with your cat and you're a Leo.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Sb! IdntotccwL. H,twb". "&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Sacre bleu! I did not think of the cat connection with Leo. However, that would be "lion."</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Shut up! A lion is just a big cat!</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>You were the only one that had means, opportunity, and motive.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Wdyl,ymcwfmwtiao. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Well done young lady, you must come work for me when this is all over.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>No! You mustn't do that. You will inherit the money now and you don't need his approval. Start your own business. That is the only thing I will ask of you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Oh, Johnny! I wish you had found me first. We would still be poor but we could have been happy.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>Perhaps. But I am tired of struggling. Remember me fondly.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(JOHNNY pulls out a gun. Immediately ADELINE grabs a candlestick from the fireplace. BARTENDER pulls two guns from the gun box behind the bar. MADGE pulls a knife. The PROFESSOR grabs a rope. MADAM MAPLE pours herself a brandy. They all face each other amongst the tables.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:red;'>PROMETHEUS</span></h3>
<h3 class="hintcode">Dnbs! Yckaou. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="hinttooltip" style="display: none;">Do not be stupid! You cannot kill all of us.</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>No, but I could just kill you for fun.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Please. Don't.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(JOHNNY wavers. MADAM MAPLE throws brandy in his face. ADELINE uses the candlestick to chop the gun from his hand. The PROFESSOR ropes him.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>I will want my handcuffs back when this is all said and done.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(They handcuff JOHNNY to the chair.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>Now that we know who the murderer is and he's all tied up - I'm starving.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(All the other characters agree.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>Thank God we are at the Almont and can have a well-deserved dinner.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>Adeline, would you like to have dinner now?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>ADELINE</span></h3>
<h3>My dear, no, you showed your true colors. Madge and Madam Maple, would you like to get dinner?</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADGE</span></h3>
<h3>I would love to.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>MADAM MAPLE</span></h3>
<h3>Poutine sounds great right now.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:green;'>(MADAM MAPLE, MADGE, and ADELINE exit by the bar.)</span></h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>JOHNNY</span></h3>
<h3>I'll eat dinner with you.</h3>
<h3><span style='color:blue;'>PROFESSOR</span></h3>
<h3>(either) Shut Up. (or) Sure, why not.</h3>
